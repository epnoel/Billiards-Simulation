# Billiards / Pool Simulation

A 2D simulation based on real-world billiards. Simulation was made in C++ and using SFML library.

## Intructions:

- In order to aim a ball, left-click once on the desired ball and an aim line will appear; move the mouse around the ball to correctly position the aim line

- To release the ball, hold the right mouse button and a white rectangular aim bar will appear on the right; drag the mouse away  from the location that was clicked to add power to the shot and release the right mouse button to release the cue

- Must wait until all balls have stopped moving until you can shoot again

- This simulation implements no rules; any ball on the table can be shot




## Features

- Whenever a ball falls into a hole, the corresponding hole will turn green for three seconds
- Each ball that moves has a rolling animation
- The aim line of each ball can be moved through either keys (A and D) or through mouse movement

## Extra Controls

- **S** - screen capture
- **H** - Turn on / off white highlight around balls
- **T** - Turn on/off path tracker mode
- **B** - Turn on/off path predictor mode (Screenshot 4)
- **E** - Exit aim mode
- **K** - Turn on/off key mode; if on, white square will appear on bottom right of screen
- **A** - If key mode is activated and aim mode is on, move the aim line counterclockwise
- **D** - If key mode is activated and aim mode is on, move the aim line clockwise
- **= (Equal Sign)** - Increase length of aim line tip
- **- (Dash/Minus Sign)** - Decrease length of aim line tip
- **Z** - undo previous shot
